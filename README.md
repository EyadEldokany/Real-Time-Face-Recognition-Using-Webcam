# Real-Time Face Recognition Using Webcam

## Overview
This project is a real-time face recognition system that identifies known individuals using a webcam feed. The code uses the `face_recognition` library to encode known faces and compare them to those detected in the video stream. This project is suitable for applications such as attendance systems, visitor identification, and more.

## Features
- Real-time face detection and recognition using a webcam.
- Identify multiple faces from a list of known individuals.
- Draw rectangles and display names for recognized faces in the video feed.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd real-time-face-recognition
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Install required Python libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install face_recognition opencv-python numpy
   ```
   
   You also need to install `dlib` as a dependency for the `face_recognition` library. Refer to [dlib installation](http://dlib.net/compile.html) for further guidance if needed.

3. **Prepare Known Images**
   Place images of people you want to recognize in an accessible directory, ensuring they are named accordingly. Update the paths in the script to point to your images.

## Usage
Run the script using Python:
```bash
python face_recognition_webcam.py
```

The webcam feed will open, and the program will recognize faces and display their names in real-time.

Press **'q'** to quit the webcam feed.

## How It Works
1. **Load and Encode Known Faces**: Known images are loaded and face encodings are created using the `face_recognition` library.
2. **Initialize Webcam**: A webcam feed is started using `cv2.VideoCapture(0)`.
3. **Real-Time Recognition**:
   - Every frame is captured and resized for faster processing.
   - Faces in the frame are located and encoded.
   - Each detected face encoding is compared with the known face encodings using `compare_faces`.
   - If a match is found, the name of the person is displayed.
4. **Display Results**: Detected faces are highlighted with rectangles, and their names are displayed.

## Dependencies
- **Python 3.x**
- **face_recognition**: A library that wraps around `dlib` for face detection and recognition.
- **OpenCV (`cv2`)**: Used for capturing the webcam feed and displaying the results.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

To install these dependencies:
```bash
pip install face_recognition opencv-python numpy
```

## Acknowledgments
- This project utilizes the [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) library, built on `dlib`, which provides state-of-the-art face detection and face recognition algorithms.
- Special thanks to the contributors of the open-source libraries used in this project.

Feel free to update the `known_face_names` and file paths in the script to add more individuals you'd like to recognize, or modify the README to include any specific details relevant to your use case.
